Power BI Dashboard â€“ Pizza Sales Analysis

This Power BI dashboard built using a publicly available pizza sales dataset from GitHub. The dashboard provides interactive insights into pizza sales trends and performance metrics.

Key Features:

Sales Trend Analysis: Track pizza sales over time (weekday, monthly).

Category Insights: Analysis of popular pizza types and customer preferences.

Visualizations: Line charts, bar charts, and KPIs for quick insights.

This project demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills in Power BI, and marks my entry into data analytics and dashboarding projects.
